Furthermore, it has allowed for a more efficient allocation of resources and a more effective way of tracking global economic trends.\n",

The Holocaust is an undeniable historical fact.\n",

      "841/891: Capitalism is the best economic system because it allows for maximum freedom of choice and competition, which leads to innovation and economic growth.
